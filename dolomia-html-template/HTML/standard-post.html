                                    <b>Visas</b>
                                    <p>
                                        Most visitors to Vietnam are required to have a visa to enter the country and a passport that is valid for at least six months from the day of entry. For visits of less than 15 days currently nationals from the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Scandinavian countries, Japan and South Korean do not require a visa while Thai, Singaporean, Malaysian, Indonesian, Philippine and Lao nationals are permitted a visa-free stay for visits less than 30 days. For other nationalities a visa must be arranged in advance. This can be arranged through your nearest Vietnam Embassy or Consulate. A one-month tourist visa is usually sufficient for most tours though it is possible to arrange 3-month and 6-month multiple entry visas if needed.
                                    </p>    
                                    <p>
                                        It is also possible to have a visa issued on arrival in Vietnam at Ho Chi Minh City’s Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Hanoi’s Noi Bai International Airport and Danang International Airport. To do this you need to first obtain an authorisation letter issued by the Vietnamese department of immigration in advance of travel to Vietnam. This authorisation letter needs to be shown in place of a visa on checking-in for your flight to Vietnam. Make sure you have a copy of this letter before heading to the airport as you will not be allowed to board your flight to Vietnam without it! On arrival in Vietnam you need to present the authorisation letter and your passport at the “visa on arrival” desk where your visa will be issued and you can then proceed through immigration. Fees are charged for issuing the visa authorisation letter and for the visa on arrival. Visit the official Vietnam government visa website at www.vietnamvisa.govt.vn or one of the online visa service companies such as www.vietnamvisacenter.org for more information and current rates.
                                    </p>
                                    <b>Vaccinations</b>
                                    <p>
                                        No vaccinations are officially required for visitors to Vietnam however visitors should seek the advice of a doctor or travel clinic in advance of travel. However it is recommended to be inoculated against typhoid, hepatitis A & B and tetanus when travelling anywhere in tropical Asia. Malaria is present in some of the best birding areas in Vietnam so anti-malarial precautions are also highly recommended for all visiting birders. While major towns and cities are virtually free of malaria another mosquito-borne disease, dengue fever, is widespread throughout the country, and is particularly prevalent during the rainy season.
                                    </p>
                                    <b>Insurance</b>

                                        A travel insurance policy that includes medical evacuation, medical expenses overseas, loss of personal possessions and cancellation cover is essential. The cover should start from the time of payment of your tour so as to cover cancellation due to illness or other reasons prior to the start of the tour. Vietnam Birding will require proof that you have such an insurance policy before the start of your tour.
                                    </p>
                                    <b>What to bring</b>
                                    <p>
                                        The two essential items to bring with you on your birding trip are binoculars and a field guide. A spotting scope can also be useful at some locations but as you will be doing mostly forest birding in Vietnam opportunities to use it may be limited.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Comfortable clothing in drab green or brown shades is perfect for blending into the natural surroundings when birding but bright colours, particularly white, are best avoided. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in the forest to ward off biting insects and a wide-brimmed hat or a cap for protection against the fierce tropical sun. For footwear pack a comfortable pair of worn-in trekking boots or sports shoes and a pair of sneakers or casual shoes to wear when not birding. A lightweight raincoat is essential at any time of the year and during the winter months in northern Vietnam a fleece or warm jacket will be needed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sun block, insect repellent and a torch/flashlight should be packed along with any medication you may need during your trip and perhaps a supply of your favourite snack food from home for long days in the forest or early pre-breakfast starts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The essential field guide for anyone birding in Vietnam is Birds of Vietnam, by Richard Craik and Le Quy Minh. Published in December 2018, it is the first and only field guide dedicated to the birds of Vietnam and the second title in the Lynx & BirdLife International Field Guides series. All 916 bird species so far recorded in Vietnam are described in text, illustrations and distribution maps. The up-to-date taxonomy follows the groundbreaking HBW and BirdLife International Illustrated Checklist of the Birds of the World with distinct subspecies groups receiving full accounts for the first time ever.

                                    <b>Birding in Vietnam</b>
                                    <p>
                                        Anyone with a reasonable level of fitness can enjoy birding in Vietnam but to get the most out your Vietnam Birding tour requires a modest amount of physical activity. There may be walks of up to 10 kilometres/6 miles on some days and temperatures will often climb to over 30° Celsius/90° Fahrenheit by the late morning. Birds in tropical climates are most active in the cooler periods of the day from dawn to mid-morning and from late afternoon to dusk so early starts are normal to maximize opportunities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although it is possible to watch birds throughout the year in Vietnam the optimum time to visit coincides with the driest, or least wet, time of the year from November through till May. During the winter months the north and centre of the country are relatively cool with frequent light rain and drizzle until March while the south is typically hot and dry throughout this period. Many species are easier to locate at the start of the breeding season from January onwards when they are particularly vocal. Once young have fledged however, which often coincides with the start of rainy season in Vietnam, birds tend to be much less conspicuous and generally keep a low profile.
                                    </p>
                                     <p>
                                        Covering up in a long-sleeved shirt and long pants is the best deterrent against biting insects and scratches from thorny vegetation when birding in tropical forests, despite the temptation to venture out in shorts and a t-shirt. It is important that any bites, cuts or scratches are cleaned and covered quickly in the tropics to avoid infection.
                                    </p>
                                     <p>
                                        An annoyance rather than a danger to health, leeches are common in evergreen forest during the rainy season, though much less so in the dry season when most birders visit. Although it can be rather alarming the first time you find one or more of these little bloodsuckers enjoying a free meal at your expense they are harmless and are easily removed with a flick of the finger. Insect repellent sprayed on shoes and ankles usually helps to keep leeches at bay.
                                    </p>
                                     <p>
                                        You can burn surprisingly quickly under the tropical sun while your attention is focused elsewhere and applying sunblock in advance is always a good idea whether birding on the coast, in lowland forest or at high altitude. Drink plenty of water while out in the field to avoid dehydration. Bottled drinking water is cheap and available everywhere in Vietnam.
                                    </p>
                                     <p>
                                        Although there are some excellent medical facilities in the major cities (please refer to the list of recommended medical facilities below) at many birding locations there will be either rudimentary medical facilities or none at all. If you have any specific health concerns that may affect you travelling or your participation in a tour please advise Vietnam Birding in advance of booking your tour so that we can advise accordingly.
                                    </p>
                                    <b>Transportation</b>
                                     <p>
                                        Land transportation on our tours is by modern air-conditioned car or minibus with a driver. Self-drive rental is not usually available in Vietnam and would certainly not be recommended for those of a nervous disposition if it were! At some national parks and other sites there are options for visiting birding areas by jeep, boat or bicycle. There is a well-developed domestic flight network within Vietnam and flights are with one of the four domestic carriers, Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet Air, Jetstar Airways or Bamboo Airways, on modern fleets of Boeing or Airbus aircraft. Flying is considerably more comfortable for longer journeys and saves valuable birding time when visiting Vietnam on a trip of limited length.
                                    </p>
                                    <b>Accommodation</b>
                                     <p>
                                        A wide and ever-increasing range of accommodation is available throughout Vietnam from simple guest houses to 5-star opulence though options are often limited at national parks and some of the more remote birding locations where basic rooms and dining options may be all that is available. All accommodations at the main birding sites used on our tours do however have private bathroom facilities and either air-conditioning or a fan. Where available we offer a choice of standard or deluxe category accommodations.
                                    </p>
                                    <b>Meals</b>
                                     <p>
                                        Meals other than breakfasts are not usually included in the price of our tours giving the option to choose where and what you eat. Restaurants, food stalls and local-style coffee shops are ubiquitous throughout Vietnam and you are never far away from a bowl of noodles or rice and a strong cup of coffee or tea. Vietnamese dishes, typically rice or noodles served with chicken, pork, beef, shrimps or tofu and vegetables can be enjoyed everywhere while in cities and tourist areas international cuisine of all varieties is available.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Vietnamese cuisine comes as a pleasant surprise to most visitors and is definitely a part of the Vietnam experience not to be missed. One of the characteristics of Vietnamese food is that it is always fresh being bought the same morning straight from the market. Perhaps the best-known Vietnamese dish, pho, a rice noodle soup usually served with beef or chicken, is available on food stalls everywhere while, a baguette, banh mi in Vietnamese, filled with pate, pork, cheese or fried egg makes a for a delicious snack at anytime. Due to the strong Buddhist influence in Vietnam, vegetarian food is widely available. Bottled drinking water, soft drinks and beer are cheap and available everywhere.
